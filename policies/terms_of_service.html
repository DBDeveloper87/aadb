This Agreement sets forth the general terms of service of your use of the https://www.aadb.org website and any of its products or services (collectively, "Website" or "Services").</p>

		<h2>Accounts and membership</h2>
		<p>If you create an account on the Website, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with it.

You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</p>

		<h2>AADB-L Email List Guidlines and Rules</h2>
		<p>We have received numerous requests to control some of the dialogue on the AADB-L list. Many people have reported that they avoid posting their opinions because they would rather not be attacked by others through inflammatory and personal emails. So we have agreed to exert more control over the content of the list. While some might see this as censorship, we believe it is critical to maintain an open and constructive dialogue.<</p>

		<h3>Purpose of the AADB-L Email List Serv</h3>
		<p>All AADB members in good standing are permitted to join the ListServ, if they choose. Participating members must agree to follow ListServ rules and guidelines. Those who habitually fail to follow the rules and guidelines will have all their messages sent to the Moderator before posting. The ListServ Liaison will be a member of the Board of Directors and will be the contact person between the ListServ and the Board.</p>

		<p>Framework and Set up</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The ListServ will be provided by an online entity approved by the Board.</li>
			<li>Members will be given instructions on how to sign up on the ListServ.</li>
			<li>The ListServ will be moderated by a member as co-moderator and by an AADB board member as the ListServ Liaison, who will hold co-moderator status and monitor messages for appropriateness.</li>
			<li>Members who have a dispute with the operation of the ListServ or the Moderator will consult the ListServ Liaison.</li>
			<li>Members will not post complaints or disputes to the ListServ itself, but will follow the guidelines for Filing a Complaint listed below.</li>
			<li>When there isn't a member willing to serve as Moderator, the ListServ will be moderated by the ListServ Liaison and the AADB President until a volunteer member is found to fulfill these duties.</li>
			<li>Resolution of disputes and disciplinary actions will be handled by ListServ Directors, consisting of the AADB Executive Committee, the ListServ Moderator, and the ListServ Liaison. Should the number of ListServ Directors be an even number, the AADB President shall abstain from any votes for resolutions.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<ol>
			<h3><li>About the AADB-L ListServ</h3>
				<p>The AADB-L ListServ is available to share information, resources, advocacy, networking and enthusiasm about AADB for its members. These rules are meant to facilitate that purpose. Membership in the ListServ is a privilege of membership in AADB. Failure to comply with its rules can result in the loss of that privilege. Questions about these rules should be sent to the AADB-L ListServ Liaison.</p>

					<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
						<p>AADB-L is an un-moderated ListServ. That means posts are distributed immediately and automatically without prior review. All AADB members have access to the ListServ if they choose.</p>

						<p>AADB takes no responsibility for personal information included in list posts. AADB cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any post or that information will not be shared. Therefore, it is the list member's responsibility to exercise caution in sharing information via the ListServ and to be aware of the practical limits of confidentiality on any ListServ. It is also each poster's responsibility to comply with defamation laws and all other applicable laws. AADB is not responsible for list content or the distribution of list posts.</p>
			</li>

			<h3><li>Content Rules</h3>
				<p>All users of the AADB-L ListServ must agree to the rules of conduct outlined below. Your agreement to the following is assumed implicitly when you become a member of the AADB-L ListServ or send and receive messages in regards to the AADB-L ListServ.</p>

					<h4><li>Unprofessional Postings</h4>
						<p>No foul language or inappropriate slang.</p>

					</li>

					<h4><li>Threatening Postings</h4>
						<p>No flaming or "personal attacks".</p>

						<p>Disagreeing with someone's opinion is not a personal attack, but rudeness, derogatory personal remarks (either directly to or about a member), including calling names or adding childish remarks, and/or not showing respect for another's right to express their opinion is not allowed.</p>

						<p>Any communications that are normally considered obscene, racist, sexually explicit, religious or other types of defamation, libelous, false, indecent, lewd, violent, abusive, threatening, harassing, or disruptive, or that may constitute grounds for civil liability is also not allowed.</p>
					</li>

					</li>

					<h4><li>Confidentiality</h4>

Forwarding list posts, sharing content from posts, or sharing email addresses of other list members without prior permission will be grounds for removal from the list.

					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>

			<h3><li>Format Rules</h3>
				<p>These are some guidelines that we ask you to follow to improve usability of the list.</p>

				<h4>Guidelines of Etiquette</h4>
					<p>Please follow these ideas so you may contribute to the conversation, be understood and not overwhelm others' email systems.</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Include Your Name</strong>
							<p>To frame your perspectives, it's useful to include your first and last name.</p>
						</li>
			
						<li><strong>Use the Subject Line</strong>
							<p>State concisely and clearly the specific topic of the comments in the subject line. This allows members to respond more appropriately to your posting and makes it easier for members to search the archives by subject.</p>
						</li>

						<li><strong>Think About Your Audience</strong>
							<p>Only send a message to the entire list when it contains information that everyone may benefit from.</p>
						</li>

						<li><strong>Keeping Things Organized</strong>
							<p>It is easier to follow a discussion on a topic if it is not broken across multiple threads. Keeping all related messages within a single thread keeps us organized, and makes following a discussion a breeze.</p>
						</li>

						<li><strong>Check the "To:" Field</strong>
							<p>When responding to a message from the list please check the "to:" field to determine whether your message is addressed to the whole list, or just the sender of the message. Messages such as "thanks for the information" or "can you send to me, too" should be addressed to individuals--not to the entire list. Do this by using your e-mail application's forwarding option or by typing in or cutting and pasting in the e-mail address of the individual to whom you want to respond.</p>
						</li>

						<li><strong>Use the Google Group page or the contact the Moderators to change your mail settings, request assistance with email changes, or to unsubscribe.</strong>
							<p>Do not post these requests to the ListServ. Please refer to the "Setting your List Options" for No Mail, Abridged Email, Daily Digest, or Individual Emails below in section 6.</p>
						</li>

						<li><strong>Quoted Material In A Reply</strong>
							<p>As a courtesy to all it is appreciated when you delete any or all of the original quoted content in a reply. Include only the relevant portions of the original message in your reply, delete any header information, and put your response before the original posting. Keep what is needed so your reply makes sense, but delete the excess.</p>
						</li>

						<li><strong>Attention to Viruses</strong>
							<p>The consequences of posting documents containing viruses are widely known. Therefore, do not upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment. If we deem that viruses are being spread by a member, either knowingly or not, we will suspend membership until we have assurances that the problem has been corrected. Please let us know if you are experiencing a problem with viruses from one or more individuals.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
			</li>
		
		<h3><li>Rule Violations</h3>
			<h4>Consequences For Misuse</h4>
			<p>In the event that any inappropriate posting or unauthorized use of the ListServ is brought to AADB's attention, including but not limited to prohibited posting and usage as outlined herein, AADB will take all appropriate action, in its sole discretion. AADB reserves the right to terminate, without prior notice, the ListServ access of any user who does not abide by these guidelines.</p>

			Intervention Steps
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Intervention Step 1:</strong>
					<p>If a member sends a post to the ListServ that is deemed to violate the above rules, no notification will be sent before action is taken. The member will be put on moderated status for a period of one week (or until the moderator is satisfied that the member has cleaned up their emails) and will be contacted by the ListServ Liaison, who will send a standardized warning about the infraction. (See Exhibit A "ListServ Warning Message") There are several exceptional conditions that could lead to immediate removal from the list</p>

					<p><strong>ListServ Warning Message (Exhibit A)</strong></p>
					<p><em>Dear AADB-L Member,<br>
						The message you posted to the AADB-L ListServ on (insert date and time, if multiple messages were sent) was inappropriate for the AADB-L ListServ because it violated ListServ rules. This is just a reminder that messages containing political, religious, commercial, or divisive content, as defined in the AADB-L ListServ Community Guidelines and posted on the ListServ, are prohibited. Excessive violation of the ListServ rules may result in your future messages being moderated, or your ability to post messages denied.<br><br>
						Thank you.
					</em></p>
				</li>

				<li><strong>Intervention Step 2:</strong>
					<p>If after being returned to un-moderated status that member again violates the rules, the member will be informed that this is their second violation of the rules and will be suspended from list privileges for a period not to exceed 30 days and will then be placed on continued moderated status. To be reinstated, the now moderated member will be asked to provide public apologies, evidence that they understand what they did and why it was a violation, and a plan for avoiding a future violations and subsequent removal.</p>
				</li>

				<li><strong>Intervention Step 3:</strong>
					<p>If after having their list privileges reinstated a member violates the rules for a third time, they will be removed from the list permanently without notice and with restrictions on re- subscribing to the ListServ. Mitigating circumstances may be cause for avoiding removal but this would be based on correspondence privately with the ListServ Directors. Re-instatement will only be allowed under unusual circumstances and are entirely at the discretion of the ListServ Directors.</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Removal from the ListServ does not constitute loss of membership in AADB.</p>
		
			<h4>Extreme incident:</h4>
			<p>Posting of illegal material, purposeful dissemination of viruses or intentional unprovoked personal attacks will result in immediate revocation of posting privileges.</p>

			<h4>Filing Complaints</h4>
			<p>Do not file a complaint to the entire ListServ. A complaint about a member's conduct can come from any member, including a board member; must be accompanied by the offending email; and must be received by the ListServ Liaison and Moderator within two weeks of occurrence. The complaint is to be made in one email to both the ListServ Liaison and Moderator, not the ListServ.</p>

			<p>The complaint will then be sent to the ListServ Directors by the ListServ Liaison to be voted upon. If the majority of the ListServ Directors agree that a rule has been broken, the above steps will be taken.</p>

			<p>Notwithstanding the above guidelines, the list ListServ Liaison/Moderator may, at any time and at his or her discretion, place the entire list or any individual member(s) on temporary moderated status to allow time for a matter to be referred to the ListServ Directors for review.</p>
