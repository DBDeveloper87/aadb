IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

			<h3>Use of "Cookies":</h3>
			<p>Our Site may use cookies to enhance your experience while using our Site. Cookies are pieces of information that some Web sites transfer to the computer that is browsing that Web site and are used for record-keeping purposes at many Web sites.
